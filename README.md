## Creating a 3D game in Unity

*Guy in the sky was created using the Unity Game Engine and free 3D resources. The goal is to move Guy from his starting island to the end island by jumping and running. Three level scenes exist. Each level will run a timer to keep track of how fast the player completes the level.*

**Concepts:**
1. Collisions
2. Player Control
3. Menus/UI
4. Animations
5. Audio

## Learning Experience
Audio counts big time. Yes, I learned some technical principles while creating this game, but they all pale in comparison to learning the value of good audio. I have taken it for granted in so many games, but it really does help secure the "physicality" of your game and immerse the player. I would say I am far from mastering it, but I had a lot of fun playing with the different elements of adding audio to a game. For sure all my future creations will benefit from this, game or not.
